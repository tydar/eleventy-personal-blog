I'm currently working on two major projects:

1. [KVM Conjurer](https://github.com/tydar/kvm-conjurer): a web application intended for simple management of single-host KVM guests. I am developing this project both to learn more about KVM, qemu, and using libvirt to manage them and also to use as a day-to-day interface on some of my homelab machines.

2. AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification: I am studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. I have always had an interest in cloud infrastructure and am planning to develop that interest into a career in IT operations.

While these are my two current main projects, you'll find posts on this site about a lot of other topics. I have a homelab for learning more about lower-level virtualization, the hardware and software supporting cloud service providers, non-platform-specific configuration tools like Ansible and Terraform, and other topics.

I'm using that local homelab environment to provide the CI/CD platform and testing environments for my KVM Conjurer project--so I plan to continue posting about that process as I develop the project.

Finally, I'm currently working in a helpdesk position at an IoT device company and might occasionally post about tools and skills I am developing in that role.
