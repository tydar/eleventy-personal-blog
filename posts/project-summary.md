I'm currently working on two major projects:

[KVM Conjurer](https://github.com/tydar/kvm-conjurer): a web application intended for simple management of single-host KVM guests. I am developing this project both to learn more about KVM, qemu, and using libvirt to manage them and also to use as a day-to-day interface on some of my homelab machines.

Unnamed no-code product catalog: an Amazon Honeycode app designed to manage information about a product catalog for use by technical support teams. Allows easy lookup and navigation of data about supported products.

While these are my two current main projects, you'll find posts on this site about a lot of other topics. I have a homelab for learning more about lower-level virtualization, the hardware and software supporting cloud service providers, non-platform-specific configuration tools like Ansible and Terraform, and other topics.

I'm using that local homelab environment to provide the CI/CD platform and testing environments for my KVM Conjurer project--so I plan to continue posting about that process as I develop the project.

Finally, I'm currently working in a helpdesk position at an IoT device company and might occasionally post about tools and skills I am developing in that role.
