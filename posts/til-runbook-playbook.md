The terms 'playbook' and 'runbook' are used very often in the Amazon Well-Architected Whitepapers. The terms are often used to mean the same or similar things out in the world. The AWS WA Framework documentation differentiates this way:

* _Runbook_: defines the procedures oriented to a certain outcome. Minimum information necessary to perform procedure. Developed from an effective manual process and later transformed into code that can be automated when appropriate.
* _Playbook_: predfined steps to perform to identify an issue. Results from a process step are used to determine the next steps to take until the issue is IDed or escalated.
