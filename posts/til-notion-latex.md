I've been testing out [Notion](https://notion.so) as a place to keep my notes for the Amazon Solutions Architect certification. Today, I wanted to write out an equation in my notes. To write an inline equation in Notion, you use the command `/equation` and choose `Inline Equation` from the list. Then, you can enter LaTeX and see how it renders in the document itself.

For example, regarding reliability and availability metrics, I wrote this equaition inline:

```latex
\frac{\text{Available Time}}{\text{Total Time}}
```

and the equation rendered inline in my notes.
