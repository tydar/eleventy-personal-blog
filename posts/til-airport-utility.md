When setting up wireless APs in a new space (or evaluating problems with something like a wireless IoT device) you can use the Apple tool AirPort utility on an iPhone. To use the wifi scanner tool with any network, you need to turn on the Wifi Scanner feature in the phone settings.

Once you do, you can use your AirPort Utility app to measure the signal strength of wireless networks in the area and see what channels the networks are broadcasting on. The signal strength is displayed in decibel-miliwatts (dBm), where the closer to zero the negative number is, the stronger the signal is at the current location.
